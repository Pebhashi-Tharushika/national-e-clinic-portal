      <h6>Trust between our customers (patients) and us is essential to ensuring a reliable and efficient e-clinic
        experience. If customers have any questions about our e-clinic portal, they can reach out to us anytime. Similarly, if they
        have any specific requests, they can submit them through the portal. We are always here to assist our customers.</h6>
      <h6>If a customer requires support related to the national e-clinic system, we should address their concerns promptly.
        However, if a request or inquiry falls outside our policies or terms and conditions, the administrator should escalate it
        to the top level of the national e-clinic system without addressing it individually.</h6>
      <h6>Additionally, administrators have the authority to block any spam messages sent to our e-clinic portal to maintain
        a secure and efficient communication channel.</h6>
